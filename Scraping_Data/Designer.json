We\u2019re looking for a passionate candidate who gets excited about the opportunity to join our journey and impact 40,000,000 consumers (and counting).\nSenior Product Designer objective:\nAs a Senior Product Designer at Roundforest, you will be responsible for creating friendly, visually appealing and usable products. You will own the design of one of our products and work collaboratively with your pod (product manager, engineers, data analysts) as well as your guild (other product designers) to deliver high-quality products that meet the needs of our users.\n**Please attach an updated portfolio to your application**\nAt Roundforest, we value creative thinking and therefore often will do things differently. Accordingly, Roundforest's Senior Product Designer role may differ in a few ways from similar positions out there:\nOur product designers work as part of a product pod, which is a bit like a little start up within a start up. Instead of designers working in isolation or only with other designers, here they closely collaborate with cross-functional individuals (product managers, data analysts, engineers) to create impactful solutions that address real user problems. By working in pods, designers are able to fully immerse themselves in the product and gain a deep understanding of the user's needs. This approach fosters a culture of innovation and creativity, and enables us to deliver products that truly resonate with our users.\nFinally, we\u2019re looking for candidates with a \u05f3hop margin\u05f3 - a secret ingredient we look for in all new hires. In other words, this position requires the candidate to leap into the next phase of their career and to step outside their comfort zone, while maintaining a reasonable learning curve. Let's evolve together!\nRequirements:\n\n5+ years of experience in product design\nData-driven with deep understanding of UX methodologies\nA proven track record of applying user-centric design principles into products\nStrong communication skills and ability to work with various stakeholder\nExcellent visual, interaction and prototyping design skills\nDiverse Perspectives\nWe know that innovation thrives on teams where diverse points of view come together to solve hard problems. As such, we explicitly seek people who bring diverse life experiences, diverse educational backgrounds, diverse cultures, and diverse work experiences. Please be prepared to share with us how your perspective will bring something unique and valuable to our team.Show more Report"}, {"company": "Valens", "job": "Board Designer", "city": "Hod HaSharon", "date": "30d+", "rating": "", "link": "https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=127&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=00000186e63872448af37e092f8830f9&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_7ec02eba&cb=1678899916958&jobListingId=1007580391524&jrtk=3-1-1grj3nc2thaqc801-1grj3gsk82a83000-95c4d946380af45e-", "description": "Responsible for developing new reference designs & applications (based on Valens chip set and various peripherals)\nCollaborate with other team members to deliver high quality board designs with a timely, successful release to production\nSupport demo shows, POCs projects and other various activities within the group\nJob Requirements\nAt least 3 years of experience with board design (analog and digital)\nHands-on experience designing and accompanying full product design process\nExperience with high-speed board/system design, schematic capture, component selection and board layout\nLab bring-up, testing, and debugging (including board-related bring-up with software, familiarity with signal-integrity aspects, etc)\nTechnical knowledge and design/working experience with PCIe, Ethernet, SerDes, I2C/SPI/MDIO\nExperience working with external designers and manufacturers of Mechanical enclosure \u2013 An advantage\nExperience working with thermal analysis \u2013 An advantage\nEMC \u2013 Experience with design and testing using external labs \u2013 An advantage\nExperience in board design for video applications (e.g. Camera, DVR or Video matrixes) \u2013 An advantage\nExcellent communication skills with fluent verbal and written EnglishReport"}, {"company": "FIVE Product Definition", "job": "PRODUCT DESIGNER hired", "city": "Petah Tikva", "date": "30d+", "rating": "", "link": "https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=128&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=00000186e63872448af37e092f8830f9&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_42abbe4e&cb=1678899918370&jobListingId=1007013697177&jrtk=3-1-1grj3ndehmbj1801-1grj3gsk82a83000-5a6c19db763ced3e-", "description": "We are looking for a truly talented Product Designer with innovative and unique creative vision;
